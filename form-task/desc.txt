## Step 1: Project Setup

1. Create a new file named `app.py` in this folder.
2. Initialize a Flask app and set a `SECRET_KEY`.
3. Add a single route `/` that supports `GET` and `POST`.

---

## Step 2: Build the HTML Form

Create a form with these fields:

- Name (text)
- Email (email)
- Password (password)
- Confirm Password (password)
- Bio (textarea, minimum 20 chars)
- Agree to Terms (checkbox)

Requirements:

- Use the correct `name` for each input.
- Use `method="post"` in the form.
- Add `required` on all fields except the bio.

---

## Step 3: Read Form Data

In your route:

1. On POST, read submitted values using `request.form.get()`.
2. Strip whitespace for text fields.
3. Store values in a dictionary called `form_data`.

---

## Step 4: Validate Inputs

Create a `validate(form_data)` function that returns a list of errors:

Validation rules:

- Name is required.
- Email must include `@`.
- Password is at least 8 characters.
- Confirm password must match password.
- Bio must be at least 20 characters if provided.
- Agree to Terms must be checked.

---

## Step 5: Show Errors Inline

If validation fails:

1. Re-render the form.
2. Display errors near the form.
3. Refill the inputs with the user’s previous values (except password).

---

## Step 6: Flash + Redirect

If validation passes:

1. `flash()` a success message.
2. Redirect back to `/` (Post/Redirect/Get).
3. Show the flashed message at the top of the form.


## Step 7: Final Checklist

- Form uses POST and route accepts POST.
- Inputs have `name` attributes.
- Server-side validation is implemented.
- Errors are displayed to the user.
- Successful POST redirects and flashes a message.
